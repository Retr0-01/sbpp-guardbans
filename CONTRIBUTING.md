You want to contribute to SourceBans++, eh?
- If you're contributing to the SourceMod plugin, then just fork the repo, and make a Pull Request.
- If you're contributing to the WebPanel, fork the repo, and make a pull request. We also need you to update the **version.json** file. You need to add up your commits in the PR, then add one more commit for the Merge. Then add the counted up commits to the **git** value.
